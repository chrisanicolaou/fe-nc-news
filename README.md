## Overview

As a part of my studies at Northcoders, I was tasked with building a front end app for my [previously created backend](https://github.com/chrisanicolaou/NC-backend-project). The intention is to mimic the functionality of forum sites like Reddit, while gaining practical knowledge for building a front end using React.

**This app has been deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and can be viewed online [here](https://glittery-crumble-9fe6a8.netlify.app/). Alternatively, if you would like to run the app locally, please follow the [setup](#setup) instructions.**
